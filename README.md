# employee-payroll-tracker

This employee payroll tracker allows the user to enter three datapoints (First Name, Last Name, and Salary) for a roster of employees. It compiles those three datapoints into an object and pushes these objects into an array of all employees. The list is alphabetized by last name, the average employee salary is generated, and the tracker can produce names at random for employee-of-the-week or -month awards.
