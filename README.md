# employee-payroll-tracker

## Description

This employee payroll tracker records employee names and salaries, generates average salary, and selects employees at random for awards.

## Features

The user can enter three datapoints (First Name, Last Name, and Salary) for a roster of employees. Salaries entered incorrectly (i.e., not as numbers) are prompted for re-entry.

The three datapoints are collected into objects, which are pushed into an array of all employees. The list is alphabetized by last name, the average employee salary is generated, and the tracker produces a name at random for employee-of-the-week or -month awards.

## credits

Source code: the majority of the HTML and CSS code, modified slightly by myself in the HTML head and the CSS background colors, and the second half of the JavaScript code (lines 65-end), were provided to me by edX/UCB Bootcamp. The first half of the JavaScript was put together with support from Zac Warner (TA) and David Park (tutor).
