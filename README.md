# employee-payroll-tracker

This employee payroll tracker allows the user to enter three datapoints (First Name, Last Name, and Salary) for a roster of employees. It alphabetizes the list by last name, generates the average salary for the team, and can produce names at random for employee-of-the-week or -month awards.
